# SearchControlAlgo_AI411
AI CSC411 Programming project 1

Implimenting one of the following search control algorithms:
a. Depth-first search
b. Breadth-first search
c. Heuristic search

the following three problems need to be solved

1. Missionary Cannibal Problem

2. The 8-puzzle problem

3. The tile problem

I can use any language I want

---

I am currently leaning to using python. As its quick, easier and familar. 
Spend more time problem solving, than wrapping my head around the code.
